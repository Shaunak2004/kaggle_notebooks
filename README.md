This file contains the code for a digit recogniser build with a model of CNNs which is coded using keras.
And it also contains a code from scratch for VGG CNN which is made using PyTorch, but it is not completely useful. And contains mainly the architecture.
The prediction was done and verified using the dataset of kaggle for Digit Recogniser.
